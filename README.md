In an era marked by technological advancements, the integration of computer vision and artificial intelligence has opened up new avenues for addressing critical societal issues. This project, titled "Enhancing Road Safety through Computer Vision," represents a groundbreaking endeavor in the realm of traffic management and road safety. The primary objective is to harness the power of smart cameras and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to prevent traffic accidents and improve road safety.

Through a comprehensive approach encompassing data collection, model training, real-time detection, decision-making, and advanced reporting mechanisms, this project seeks to create an intelligent traffic control system that goes beyond traditional traffic management. By detecting vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic lights in real time and dynamically adapting traffic signal timings, this system aims to prevent accidents, reduce traffic congestion, and contribute to a safer and more efficient road infrastructure.
